Python provides a way to access and utilize these operating system-specific functionalities through modules like os.\n\nFor example, using operating system dependent functionality in Python, you can:\n\nAccess and manipulate files and directories using functions like os.path for path manipulation or os.listdir for listing files in a directory.\nExecute system commands or programs using os.system or subprocess modules.\nManage environment variables using os.environ.\nInteract with the network, sockets, or network interfaces using the socket module.\nRetrieve information about the system using functions like os.cpu_count for CPU information or os.uname for system information.\nBy utilizing operating system dependent functionality in Python, you can create programs that interact with and utilize the resources and capabilities provided by the underlying operating system. This allows for more powerful and flexible applications that can adapt to the specific environment in which they are running.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = apikey","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The line os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = apikey sets the value of the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY to the value stored in the apikey variable.\n\nIn Python, the os.environ dictionary provides access to the environment variables of the operating system. By assigning a value to a specific key in the os.environ dictionary, we can set or modify the value of an environment variable.\n\nIn this case, the code is setting the value of the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable to the value stored in the apikey variable. This is likely done to store the API key required for authentication with the OpenAI API. By setting the environment variable, the API key can be accessed later in the code without explicitly exposing it in the script, which helps to keep sensitive information secure.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# App framework\nst.title('ðŸ¦œðŸ”— YouTube GPT Creator')\nprompt = st.text_input('Plug in your prompt here') ","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* st.title('ðŸ¦œðŸ”— YouTube GPT Creator'): This line sets the title of the web application to \"ðŸ¦œðŸ”— YouTube GPT Creator\".
